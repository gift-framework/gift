## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `theory/description` - Theoretical developments
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `test/description` - Testing improvements

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add new geometric parameter validation
fix: correct numerical precision in H‚ÇÄ calculation
docs: update theoretical foundation section
test: add validation for E‚Çà√óE‚Çà constraints
```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Jupyter Notebooks
- Clear markdown explanations
- Well-commented code cells
- Organized cell structure
- Include validation checks

### Mathematical Notation
- Use consistent notation with the theoretical papers
- Include units where appropriate
- Document parameter definitions clearly
- Maintain precision in calculations

## Testing Requirements

### Validation Tests
All changes must pass the GIFT validation suite:
```python
# Mean deviation must remain < 1.0%
gift = GIFTCoreFramework()
predictions = gift.calculate_predictions()
deviations = gift.calculate_deviations(predictions)
mean_deviation = sum(deviations.values()) / len(deviations)
assert mean_deviation < 1.0
```

### Geometric Constraints
Verify that geometric constraints are satisfied:
```python
constraints = gift.validate_geometric_constraints()
assert all(constraint['satisfied'] for constraint in constraints.values())
```

### Unit Tests
Add unit tests for new functionality:
```python
def test_new_feature():
    # Test implementation
    assert result == expected
```

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document all public functions and classes
- Include mathematical formulas in docstrings
- Provide usage examples
- Explain theoretical background

### Theoretical Documentation
