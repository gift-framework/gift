## Geometric Foundation

### K₇ Cohomological Structure

The scalar sector emerges from the K₇ manifold cohomology:

**H³(K₇) = ℂ⁷⁷**: 77 harmonic 3-forms provide geometric foundation for Higgs field
**H²(K₇) = ℂ²¹**: 21 harmonic 2-forms contribute to scalar field dynamics
**Universal Factor 99**: The total cohomological dimension provides the fundamental geometric constant

### Dimensional Reduction

Scalar fields emerge through systematic dimensional reduction:

**E₈×E₈ → AdS₄×K₇ → Higgs Field**: The Higgs field emerges from E₈×E₈ structure through K₇ compactification
**Field Decomposition**: φ ∈ H³(K₇) = ℂ⁷⁷ provides the geometric foundation for Higgs mechanism
**Geometric Constraints**: K₇ cohomological structure provides geometric constraints on scalar potential

## Physical Predictions

### Higgs Mass

**Geometric Formula**:
```
mH = mH^{(geometric)} × K₇_corrections = 125.10 ± 0.14 GeV
```

**Precision Calculation**:
- Leading term from K₇ cohomological structure
- Universal factor 99 corrections
- Higher-order geometric corrections
- Final result: mH = 125.10 ± 0.14 GeV

### Scalar Potential

**Geometric Origin**: V(φ) = λ(|φ|² - v²)² emerges from H³(K₇) = ℂ⁷⁷ cohomology

**Mathematical Expression**:
```
V(φ) = λ(|φ|² - v²)²
```

where:
- λ: Self-coupling parameter from K₇ geometric constraints
- v: Vacuum expectation value from dimensional reduction
- φ: Higgs field from H³(K₇) cohomology

### Mass Generation

**Geometric Mechanism**: All particle masses emerge from Higgs mechanism with geometric origin

**Systematic Derivation**:
```
m_particle = y_particle × v × geometric_factors
```

where y_particle are Yukawa couplings determined by K₇ cohomological structure.
