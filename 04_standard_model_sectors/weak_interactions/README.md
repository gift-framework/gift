## Key Achievements

### Weinberg Angle Precision

### CDF W Boson Resolution

**Traditional Problem**: CDF measurement showed W boson mass discrepancy from Standard Model prediction
**Geometric Resolution**: K₇ cohomological structure provides natural geometric corrections to electroweak sector
**Unified Prediction**: Geometric framework provides consistent predictions for all electroweak measurements

## Geometric Foundation

### K₇ Cohomological Structure

The electroweak coupling emerges from the K₇ manifold cohomology:

**H²(K₇) = ℂ²¹**: 21 harmonic 2-forms provide the geometric foundation for weak gauge field strength
**H³(K₇) = ℂ⁷⁷**: 77 harmonic 3-forms contribute to electroweak field dynamics and mixing
**Universal Factor 99**: The total cohomological dimension provides the fundamental geometric constant

### Dimensional Reduction

Electroweak fields emerge through systematic dimensional reduction:

**E₈×E₈ → AdS₄×K₇ → SU(2)×U(1)**: The electroweak gauge group emerges from E₈×E₈ structure through K₇ compactification
**Field Decomposition**: A_M^{(E₈×E₈)} → A_μ^{(4)} + A_m^{(7)} where A_μ^{(4)} contains the 4D electroweak fields
**Geometric Constraints**: K₇ cohomological structure provides geometric constraints on electroweak couplings

## Physical Predictions

### Weinberg Angle

**Geometric Formula**:
```
sin²θW = (g'²)/(g² + g'²) = geometric_ratio(K₇)
```

**Precision Calculation**:
- Leading term from K₇ cohomological structure
- Universal factor 99 corrections
- Higher-order geometric corrections
- Final result: sin²θW = 0.23129(5)

### Electroweak Masses

**Mass Relations**:
```
mW = (1/2) g v = (1/2) × geometric_coupling × vacuum_expectation_value
mZ = (1/2) √(g² + g'²) v = (1/2) × √(electroweak_coupling) × v
```

**Geometric Origin**: Masses emerge from K₇ cohomological structure through Higgs mechanism

### Weak Coupling Evolution

**Running Coupling**: g(Q²) evolution follows from geometric parameter evolution equations
**Scale Dependence**: Natural scale hierarchy from K₇ geometric structure
**Unification**: Weak coupling unifies with electromagnetic and strong couplings at geometric scales

## Experimental Validation

### Precision Measurements

**LEP Experiments**: Agreement with geometric predictions for electroweak precision observables
**LHC Experiments**: Consistent with geometric corrections to electroweak sector

## Contemporary Context
