## Theoretical Question
A clear and concise description of your theoretical question.

## Context
Provide context about which part of the GIFT framework this relates to:
- [ ] E₈×E₈ geometric structure
- [ ] Dimensional reduction (AdS₄×K₇)

- [ ] Mathematical constants integration
- [ ] Observable predictions
- [ ] Validation methodology
- [ ] Other: ___________

## Specific Areas
- Which geometric parameters are involved? [e.g. ξ, τ, β₀, δ]
- Which observables are relevant? [e.g. α⁻¹, H₀, sin²θ_W, f_π]
- Which mathematical concepts? [e.g. cohomology, exceptional groups, ζ-functions]

## Background
What is your background in theoretical physics? This helps us provide an appropriate level of explanation.

## Expected Answer Type
- [ ] Mathematical derivation
- [ ] Physical interpretation
- [ ] Computational implementation
- [ ] Literature reference
- [ ] Open research question

## Additional Context
Add any other context, equations, or references that might be relevant.
